# Glints Aries

<code>v{version}</code>

Glints Aries is Glints' in-house React component library. Most components are specific to Glints but you're free to use them in your own projects or to fork this project to build your own component library. We also host a number of non-component code units such as colors and breakpoints.

The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/glints-dev/glints-aries). Feel free to open bug report or feature request tickets in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/glints-dev/glints-aries/issues). Or go ahead and directly submit a [pull request](https://github.com/glints-dev/glints-aries/pulls).

## How To Use

Install:

```
yarn add glints-aries
```

Then start importing and using the components:

```
import { Button } from 'glints-aries';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button variant="solid-blue" onClick={() => alert('Hello World!')}>
    Say Hello
  </Button>
)
```

## About This Documentaion

Occasionally you may come across a story where the example code is wrapped in a `<GlintsContainer__BaseContainer>` tag. This means that the component must be a descendant of a [GlintsContainer](/?path=/docs/utilities-glintscontainer--page#glintscontainer) or [BaseContainer](/?path=/docs/utilities-glintscontainer--page#basecontainer) because it depends on some "base-styles" imparted by either of those two components.

A majority of the documentation found here is auto-generated from the source code. Unfortunately this process currently has a known limitation: Standard properties of components are not always listed in the properties tables. But for most components you can assume that properties like `style`, `className` or `onClick` will work, even if not listed explicitly.
